## Motivation
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, causing up to 18 million deaths annually [[1](https://github.com/KonstantinBurkin/personalized-medicine/edit/master/README.md#References)]. CVDs are mainly manifested in the form of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Reducing premature mortality from CVDs is possible by identifying all those at highest risk and ensuring that they receive appropriate treatment. The most important condition for the provision of appropriate treatment and counseling is the identification of a clinical or biochemical markers, the value of which leads to an increased risk factor. The critical values of such traits can vary from population to population, so it is of particular importance to identify a group of traits for the Russian population that are better able to predict an increased risk factor, as well as to identify their critical values.

## Description
We are aiming:
- to analyze the medical data of patients with CVDs from Surgut Cardio Hospital; 
- to identify biomarkers correlating to the risk factor increase;
- to compare primary risk biomarkers to previously described risk factors; 
- to develop predictive machine learning models;  
- to create guidelines for cardio medical community.

And, hence, to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and cure of cardiovascular complications.
